## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites

- kubectl configured with access to your Kubernetes clusters
- Access to the Kubernetes contexts you want to port-forward from

### Homebrew (macOS) - Recommended

```bash
brew tap xlttj/tap
brew install xlttj/tap/kprtfwd
```

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/xlttj/kprtfwd@latest
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xlttj/kprtfwd/releases)
2. Extract and make executable:
   ```bash
   # For macOS/Linux
   chmod +x kprtfwd-*
   mv kprtfwd-* /usr/local/bin/kprtfwd
   ```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xlttj/kprtfwd.git
cd kprtfwd
go build -o kprtfwd main.go
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

kprtfwd stores its configuration in a local SQLite database at `~/.kprtfwd/kprtfwd.db`. The TUI manages configuration (adding/removing services, editing ports, managing projects), and changes are persisted automatically.

## üîç Service Discovery

Service discovery is fully integrated into the TUI. It scans your Kubernetes
cluster for services and lets you interactively select which ones to add as
port-forward configurations. Discovered services are saved to the local SQLite
store automatically‚Äîno YAML export/import required.

### How to open discovery

From the main view, press Ctrl+D

1) Cluster selection
   - Choose the Kubernetes context to discover
   - Navigation: Up/Down or j/k
   - Select: Enter
   - Back: Esc (returns to the main view)

2) Service selection
   - See a list of services in the selected context (with namespace, type, ports)
   - Toggle selection: Space
   - Filter the list: Press /, type text, Enter to apply (Esc to clear/cancel)
   - Edit proposed local port for a highlighted service: e
     - You can only edit newly discovered entries here; existing configs should be
       edited from the main view
   - Confirm and add selected services: Enter
   - Back to cluster selection: Esc

3) Save and use
   - After confirming, selected services are added to your configuration and
     persisted to ~/.kprtfwd/kprtfwd.db
   - You‚Äôll return to the main view where you can start/stop them with Space

Tip: You can always re-open discovery (Ctrl+D) to add more services. Use
filtering (/) to quickly narrow down large clusters.

## üéÆ Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
# Run from anywhere
kprtfwd

# Or with debug logging
DEBUG=1 kprtfwd
```

### Basic Navigation

1. Use **arrow keys** or **j/k** to navigate through port forwards
2. Press **Space** to start/stop individual port forwards
3. Press **q** to quit the application

### Quick Start Example

1. Run `kprtfwd`
2. Press Ctrl+D to open service discovery and add desired services
3. Navigate to a port forward using arrow keys
4. Press **Space** to start it
5. Press **o** to open it in your browser (if it's HTTP)

## üìÅ Projects

Projects allow you to group related port forwards and manage them as a unit.

### Creating Projects

You create and manage projects entirely in the TUI:

- Press Ctrl+P to open the Project Selector
- Press m to open Project Management
- Press n (or c) to create a new project, enter a name, then select services to include
- Press d to delete a project
- Use arrow keys and Enter to navigate and confirm

### Using Projects

1. Press **Ctrl+P** to open the project selector
2. Use **arrow keys** to select a project
3. Press **Enter** to activate the project
4. All port forwards in the project will start automatically
5. Press **Esc** to return to the main view

### Project Behavior

- **Automatic Management**: When you select a project, all currently running port forwards stop, and all port forwards in the selected project start
- **Visual Indication**: The UI shows which project is currently active
- **Filtering**: When a project is active, only its port forwards are displayed

- Respects active project filtering

### 5. Configuration Hot-reload

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port Already in Use
**Error**: `Cannot start service: port 8080 already in use`
**Solution**: 
- Check what's using the port: `lsof -i :8080` (macOS/Linux)
- Change the local port in the TUI (press e on the selected service)
- Stop the conflicting process

#### Kubernetes Connection Issues
**Error**: `Cannot connect to context 'staging'`
**Solution**:
- Verify kubectl access: `kubectl --context staging get pods`
- Check your kubeconfig: `kubectl config get-contexts`
- Ensure the context name matches exactly

#### Service Not Found
**Error**: `Service 'api-service' not found in namespace 'default'`
**Solution**:
- List services: `kubectl --context staging get svc -n default`
- Verify namespace and service name in config
- Check if the service exists in a different namespace

#### Browser Won't Open
**Error**: `Failed to open browser: exec: "#": executable file not found`
**Solution**:
- Install required tools:
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install xdg-utils`
  - Ensure your system has a default browser configured

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
DEBUG=1 kprtfwd
```

This will create detailed logs in `./kprtfwd.log` showing:
- Port forward startup/shutdown events  
- Configuration loading and parsing
- Kubernetes API interactions
- UI state changes

### Configuration Validation

The application validates your configuration on startup. Common validation errors:

- **Duplicate IDs**: Each port forward must have a unique `id`
- **Missing Required Fields**: All fields are required except `projects`
- **Invalid Project References**: Project forwards must reference existing port forward IDs
- **Port Conflicts**: Multiple forwards can't use the same local port

## üìÑ Data Storage

kprtfwd persists your port forwards and projects in a local SQLite database at `~/.kprtfwd/kprtfwd.db`. Manage everything from within the TUI.
